# Next steps

- [ ] Add routing:
   I wanted this to build as simple as a single page so I didn't use routing. But given the functionality, we can add routing and if the user is registered successfully we can redirect them to dashboard/home screen or login screen.
- [ ] forbidden password:
   We can restrict the password field such that it should not include common passwords using the validator.
- [ ] Setup husky and lint-staged to prevent unsafe code push to the repository.
- [ ] CI/CD
- [x] Live version.
- [x] Above 85% code coverage.
